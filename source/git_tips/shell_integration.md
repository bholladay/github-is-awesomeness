## Shell integration

### Autocompletion

Tough branch names are easy.

Recommend `zsh` with [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for pre-installed magic.

References: [bash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-Bash), [zsh](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-Zsh), and [others](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-in-Other-Environments-Graphical-Interfaces)


### Command-line status

Reports  what branch you are on, whether the repo is dirty, etc.

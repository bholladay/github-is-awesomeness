## Why Git?
- Ever need a version of a file from 4 days ago?
- Ever need to see what (or who) changed a file 2 weeks ago?
- Want to keep every version of an image, layout, or code?
- Ever need to fix a bug in an old version, but you're working on new version?
- Ever have two strategies for a solution, and want try them both?
- Ever work in a group on the same files?
- Ever need to know what (or who) broke the unit tests and when it happened?

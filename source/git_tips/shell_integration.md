## Shell integration

### Autocompletion

Always forgetting how to spell your coworkers' branch names?

Available for `bash`...I recommend `zsh` with its extensive plugins.

TODO: Add a link for instructions on installing autocomplete.

### Command-line status

Reports whether a directory needs a commit, what branch you are on and more.
